LeetU - A Basic REST API using Entity Framework Core and SQLite

1. Clone Repo
2. Restore Nugets (Right click solution, restore)
3. Build
4. Run

Use the Swagger UI to query the database. The database is a SqlLite database, if you wish to view or edit the data you can download the Sqlite Browser (https://sqlitebrowser.org/)

I will be adding to this project as and when I feel like it.
